# NewAED Font

A custom font for displaying the AED (UAE Dirham) currency symbol, based on the Inter font.

## About

This font was created to provide a clean, consistent way to display the AED currency symbol that matches the style of Inter, a popular sans-serif typeface. This approach follows a similar solution used for the Saudi Riyal symbol.

**This implementation is inspired by Dom Monhardt's approach** detailed in his blog post ["ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ðŸª™ The New Saudi Riyal Symbol and the Future of GCC Currencies"](https://www.one-fs.com/p/the-new-saudi-riyal-symbol-and-the), where he developed a custom font solution for the Saudi Riyal symbol.

**NewAED is a derivative work based on Inter**, with modifications focused on providing a dedicated AED currency symbol. The font has been modified from the original Inter typeface created by Rasmus Andersson.

The font contains a subset of characters, focusing specifically on the AED symbol while maintaining typographic consistency with the Inter font family.

## How It Works

The solution follows a similar approach to the Saudi Riyal symbol implementation:
- The font is a modified version of Inter where the letters 'a' and 'e' were removed, and 'd' was edited to create the AED symbol
- When applied to text displaying "AED", it renders the custom AED symbol instead
- If the font fails to load, "AED" remains as a readable fallback
- This approach ensures seamless integration while avoiding the need for image assets or vector graphics

## Usage

### Web Usage

1. Include the font in your project:
   ```
   /your-project
   â”œâ”€â”€ font/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Newaed-Regular.ttf
   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.css
   â””â”€â”€ index.html
   ```

2. Add the font-face declaration in your CSS:
   ```css
   @font-face {
     font-family: 'NewAED';
     src: url('../font/Newaed-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
     font-weight: normal;
     font-style: normal;
   }
   ```

3. Apply the font to your AED symbols:
   ```css
   .aed-symbol {
     font-family: 'NewAED', sans-serif;
   }
   ```

4. Use it in your HTML:
   ```html
   <span class="aed-symbol">AED</span> 199.99
   ```

### CSS Fallback

For better compatibility, consider using a font stack:

```css
.aed-symbol {
  font-family: 'NewAED', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Arial', sans-serif;
}
```
